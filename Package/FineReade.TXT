The cab file for your application has been built as 'E:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\Program Files\Проверка дисков и FineReader\Package\FineReader.CAB'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (E:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\Program Files\Проверка дисков и FineReader\Package\Support\FineReader.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab file in case you make changes to some of the files.
